@article{TillnerRoth1998,
abstract = {A thermodynamic model incorporating a fundamental equation of state for the Helmholtz free energy of the mixture \{water+ammonia\} is presented which covers the thermodynamic space between the solid-liquid-vapor boundary and the critical locus. It is also valid in the vapor and liquid phases for pressures up to 40 MPa. It represents vapor-liquid equilibrium properties with an uncertainty of ±0.01 in liquid and vapor mole fractions. Typical uncertainties in the single-phase regions are ±0.3\% for the density and ±200 J mol-1 for enthalpies. Details of the data selection and the optimization process are given. The behavior of the fundamental equation of state is discussed in all parts of the thermodynamic space},
